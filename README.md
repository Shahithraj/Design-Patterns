Design Patterns are standard solutions to common software design problems.
Think of them like blueprints or templates for solving particular coding problems in a reusable, efficient, and maintainable way.

 Why Do We Use Design Patterns?
→ 1. Reusability & Efficiency
Instead of reinventing the wheel, you use proven solutions. This speeds up development.

→ 2. Maintainability
Code becomes easier to read, understand, and modify when patterns are followed.

→ 3. Scalability
Patterns help you write code that's more adaptable to future changes and growth.

→ 4. Communication
Using known patterns (like "Singleton" or "Observer") helps teams communicate design ideas faster and more clearly.

→ 5. Avoid Anti-Patterns
They help you avoid poor solutions that can lead to buggy, tightly coupled, or untestable code.


Creational Patterns

Singleton – Only one instance exists.

Factory Method – Create objects without specifying the exact class.

Builder – Step-by-step object creation.

Prototype – Clone existing objects.

Abstract Factory – Factory of factories.
